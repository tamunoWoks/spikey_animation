## Wave Pattern Animation
This python script creates a wave-like animation in the terminal using dashes (-). It simulates a pulsing visual pattern by printing lines that increase and then decrease in length, with each line’s length based on the square of its index (i²).

### Features:
- **Dynamic Animation:** Smoothly grows and shrinks lines to create a rhythmic wave effect.
- **Mathematical Pattern:** Uses squared values to vary line lengths more dramatically than a linear pattern.
- **Infinite Loop:** Runs continuously, producing a looping visual until manually stopped.
- **Graceful Exit:** Can be interrupted cleanly with Ctrl+C (thanks to the try/except block with KeyboardInterrupt).
